# AEM Intern Practice Procject "Bikes" 
We are a group of AEM-dev interns at Accenture. With most of our current roadmaps done and no project talks (so far), we decided to make a mock copy of an exsiting site that was made with AEM - [harley-davidson.com](https://www.harley-davidson.com/eu/en/index.html). It was randomly chosen from [this](https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Adobe-Experience-Manager) list. 
The goal is to put our limited knowledge to the test, and become a better at working with AEM. Also learn to use GitHub. 

### Our group consists of -
Ivars Knets; LÄ«ga Rozite; Verners Grizbovskis;

### Some hints -
- When you preformed changes on a page in AEM, to snyc it to the local files go to "ui.content/src/main/content/jcr_root/content/ipp-bikes" and "Import" on that. Or just "Import" the whole "jcr_root" folder a bit above. And then you can push it to github.  

- #### How to merge your branch back to main?
    Using git in command line. 
    Use `git status` to see what branch you are on.
    Use `git checkout main` to move to main branch, if you aren't on it already.
    Then use `git merge branch-name`, replacing `branch-name` with the name of the branch you want to merge.
    If there are any conflicts and if you are doing so from an IDEs built-in command promt, then the respective files and their parent folders will have red name. Once found you can see the conflict and remove the unneeded part. 

    

# Good luck, have fun!
